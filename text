Vim is a text editor released by Bram Moolenaar in 1991 for the Amiga computer.
The name "Vim" is an acronym for "Vi IMproved" because Vim was created as an extended version of the vi editor, with many additional features designed to be helpful in editing program source code.
Although Vim was originally released for the Amiga, Vim has since been developed to be cross-platform, supporting many other platforms.
It is the most popular editor amongst Linux Journal readers.
